# Provider recipes

## Why "responses" only

codex drives custom providers exclusively over the OpenAI **Responses API**
(`wire_api = "responses"`); chat-completions support was removed from codex. A provider works
with parable's codex executors if and only if it serves an OpenAI-compatible `/responses`
endpoint. parable injects providers per-invocation with `-c model_providers.*` overrides —
it never reads or writes `~/.codex/config.toml` provider entries, so your personal codex
setup is untouched.

Check credentials and reachability any time with `parable-config.sh` (shows per-executor
key status).

## Fireworks

```toml
[providers.fireworks]
type = "codex"
base_url = "https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1"
env_key = "FIREWORKS_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Model ids are the full account path, e.g. `accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p7-code`.
The Responses endpoint is beta: most coding models run codex's multi-turn tool loop cleanly,
but some model chat-templates fail on multi-turn tool replay (symptom in the run log:
`jinja template rendering failed. Message has tool role, but there was no previous assistant
message with a tool call`) and some return persistent server errors. When a model misbehaves
on one provider, route it through another (OpenRouter, or a LiteLLM bridge) rather than
retrying — the failure is server-side and deterministic. A completed working tree with a
failed final stream is still verifiable: run `parable-verify.sh` and judge the evidence.

## OpenRouter

```toml
[providers.openrouter]
type = "codex"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
env_key = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Model ids are OpenRouter's `vendor/model` form, e.g. `minimax/minimax-m3`,
`moonshotai/kimi-k2.7`. The Responses endpoint is beta and stateless; usage responses
include a `cost` field, which run summaries surface when present.

## pi (chat-completions without a bridge)

The [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) is a second executor harness.
Where codex only drives Responses-API providers, pi speaks **plain chat-completions** (plus
`anthropic-messages` and `openai-responses`) to any base URL — so chat-only providers work
directly, no proxy in the middle:

```toml
[providers.fireworks-pi]
type = "pi"
base_url = "https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1"
env_key = "FIREWORKS_API_KEY"
api = "openai-completions"

[executors.minimax-fw]
provider = "fireworks-pi"
model = "accounts/fireworks/models/minimax-m3"
effort = "medium"
cost = { in = 0.30, out = 1.20, cache_in = 0.06 }
context_ktok = 512
```

This is also the recovery path when a provider's Responses endpoint misbehaves for a model:
the same model over chat-completions often runs the full multi-turn tool loop cleanly.

Mechanics and requirements:

- **node ≥ 22.** pi currently requires node 22+ (older node hits HTTP-client
  incompatibilities); `npx @parcha/parable doctor` checks your version. Put a node 22+ bin dir
  first on PATH (e.g. `nvm use 22`), then `npm i -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`.
  `doctor` checks both.
- **Hermetic per-run config.** parable generates `<run_dir>/pi-agent/models.json` and points
  pi at it via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`; your `~/.pi` is never written to (the hermetic dir's
  `bin/` symlinks `~/.pi/agent/bin` read-only when present, for fd/rg reuse), the API key is
  referenced as `$ENV_VAR` (resolved at request time, never on disk or in argv), and runs get
  `PI_OFFLINE=1` plus `--no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-approve` so
  nothing personal leaks in.
- **Sessions live in the run dir** (`sessions/`), so `parable-resume.sh` continues the exact
  session by id, and the session file doubles as a transcript backup.
- **Thinking:** `effort` maps to pi's `--thinking` (`off` is legal for pi executors). Models
  with baked-in reasoning may emit thinking regardless; that's the model, not a bug.

## LiteLLM proxy (bridge for chat-only providers)

Any provider that only speaks chat-completions can still back a codex executor through a
LiteLLM proxy, which serves `/v1/responses` in front of any configured model:

```toml
[providers.litellm]
type = "codex"
base_url = "http://localhost:4000/v1"   # your proxy
env_key = "LITELLM_MASTER_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Model ids are whatever aliases your proxy's `model_list` defines. If the only reason you'd
run the proxy is chat-completions translation, a `type = "pi"` provider does it without the
extra service.

## OpenAI (codex-native)

```toml
[providers.openai]
type = "codex-native"
```

Uses codex's own auth (ChatGPT login or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and model catalog — no overrides
injected beyond `model` and effort. This is the zero-risk path: codex's home models run its
harness exactly as designed.

## Cursor (cursor-agent)

```toml
[providers.cursor]
type = "cursor"                 # cursor-agent CLI; no base_url (the CLI owns its endpoint)
# env_key = "CURSOR_API_KEY"    # optional — this is the default the CLI already reads
```

A third executor harness alongside codex and pi, driven by the
[Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/cli) (`cursor-agent`). Install:
`curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash`. It reaches two model families you can't get
elsewhere: **Composer** (Cursor-exclusive — no public API, no gateway) and **Grok** (a genuine
third model family for adversarial review), plus mirrors of the Claude/GPT catalog.

- **Auth is a subscription**, not metered API keys: a user `CURSOR_API_KEY` draws on that
  account's Cursor plan. Confirm the tier with `cursor-agent about --format json`.
- **Effort rides the model slug**, not a flag: `grok-4.5-low|high|xhigh` (and a `-fast` tier);
  Composer has no effort variant. So set the full slug as `model` and treat `effort` as
  advisory metadata (parable does not gate it against the codex/pi enum for cursor executors).
  List slugs with `cursor-agent models` — route by slug, never by display name (the names are
  shifted, e.g. `grok-4.5-medium` *displays* as "Grok 4.5 Low").
- parable dispatches it as `cursor-agent -p --output-format stream-json --force --trust`, plan
  on stdin. `--force` is required or headless edits are proposed-only and the run stalls on
  approval. Sessions resume headlessly by chat id (`--resume <id>`), captured from the stream.
- Reviews run in `--plan` mode (read-only: analyze, no edits).
- **Small budget.** A Cursor plan's included budget (~$20/cycle on Pro) is orders of magnitude
  smaller than the Claude/ChatGPT plan windows and bills overage in arrears — treat cursor
  executors as a boutique lane (a fast mechanical burst, a third-family review), not bulk.
  `parable-usage.sh` shows the dollars remaining this cycle.

## Claude subagents

```toml
[providers.claude]
type = "subagent"
```

Executors on this provider are dispatched with the orchestrating harness's native agent-spawn
tool — no API keys and no CLI subprocess. `parable.py run` refuses them by design; the brain
owns subagent dispatch directly. If the current harness has no native agent-spawn tool, this
provider is unavailable.

When the session itself is launched with `parable claude`, this same provider can carry exact
third-party model ids exposed by a localhost Claude-compatible proxy:

```toml
[claude]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8317"
auth_token_env = "CLIPROXY_API_KEY"
brain_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"

[executors.kimi]
provider = "claude"
model = "kimi-k3"
use_for = "Independent implementation through the Kimi Code subscription."
```

`parable agents sync` materializes that executor as project agent `parable-kimi`; stock Claude
Code sends its child requests to `kimi-k3` through the same endpoint. The launcher strips
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`, because Claude Code gives that environment variable priority over
every agent's own `model:` field and would otherwise silently route all children to the parent.
The proxy owns provider OAuth. Parable stores no provider credential and does not implement an
OAuth flow.

### Verified GPT effort support

With stock Claude Code `2.1.215`, Sol, Terra, and Luna complete text and
tool-using requests through ChatGPT subscription OAuth. Released CLIProxyAPI
`v7.2.88` does **not** provide exact non-medium effort: Claude Code sends
`output_config.effort` but omits `thinking`, and that release translates all
five settings to `reasoning.effort=medium`. The
[released-binary receipt](../../../docs/evidence/g1-gpt-model-effort-live/receipt.json)
and [mechanism diagnosis](../../../docs/evidence/g1-gpt-model-effort-live/mechanism.md)
record the 3/15 exact baseline. Setting
`CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT=1` does not change the wire shape.

A source patch based on CLIProxyAPI commit
`93d74a890a44802f656d7f39a573916b2611896e` fixes the general
Claude-to-Codex translation boundary. Its independently built binary preserved
`low|medium|high|xhigh|max` exactly for all three models: 15/15 text cells and
3/3 medium tool canaries passed through ChatGPT OAuth. See the
[patched live receipt](../../../docs/evidence/e2-cliproxy-effort-live/receipt.json).

The patch is not an upstream release. Until CLIProxyAPI merges and releases
the change, released `v7.2.88` users must treat non-medium effort as
accepted-but-not-effective. The reproducible patched-source build route is
published separately by loop E3.

## Reading subscription headroom (parable-usage.sh)

Each subscription pool publishes its own remaining headroom over an authenticated endpoint the
official CLI already calls — `parable-usage.sh` reads them for zero model tokens and no turn,
using the same on-disk credential the local harness stored (it never mints or writes a token):

- **claude** — `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, bearer
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json → .claudeAiOauth.accessToken` (needs `user:profile` scope),
  `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. Prefers the newer `limits[]` array (`kind` = `session`
  (5h) / `weekly_all` / `weekly_scoped` per-model, `percent` 0–100, `resets_at` ISO) — the
  per-model `weekly_scoped` bucket (e.g. the brain's own model) is often the tightest window
  and the flat `five_hour`/`seven_day` fields omit it; those flat fields are the fallback.
- **codex** — `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`, bearer
  `~/.codex/auth.json → .tokens.access_token` + header `ChatGPT-Account-Id: .tokens.account_id`.
  Windows: `rate_limit.primary_window` (5h), `secondary_window` (weekly) (`used_percent`,
  `reset_at` unix). API-key auth (`OPENAI_API_KEY` in auth.json) has no plan usage — reports unknown.
- **cursor** — `POST https://api2.cursor.sh/auth/exchange_user_api_key` (bearer `$CURSOR_API_KEY`)
  → `accessToken`, then `POST …/aiserver.v1.DashboardService/GetCurrentPeriodUsage` → `planUsage`
  `{limit, remaining}` cents. The raw API key is NOT accepted on the RPC directly — the exchange
  step is mandatory.

All three are internal/undocumented (the same ones the CLIs call); shapes can drift across CLI
versions, so every probe fails soft to `unknown` on a missing credential, a stale-token 401, or
a shape change — the tool informs routing, it never blocks it. A 401 means the token is stale;
run any command for that CLI (or `codex login status`) to refresh it, then re-probe.

**Rate-limit note.** These endpoints throttle rapid polling — Claude's `/api/oauth/usage` in
particular trips a multi-minute HTTP 429 cooldown after a burst. `parable-usage.sh` therefore
caches each pool's read on disk for ~45s (`CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`): repeated calls within the window
reuse the last read instead of re-hitting the endpoint, and if a live probe does 429, the last
good read is served marked `(cached Ns)` rather than dropping the pool to `unknown`. So you can
call `parable usage` freely; don't build a sub-second poller around the raw endpoints yourself.

## Driving codex directly (beyond parable.py)

The dispatcher covers the common path; codex itself offers more when the brain needs it:

- `codex fork <session>` — branch an existing session to try alternative fixes in parallel
  without losing the original context.
- `codex apply` — apply the latest diff a codex session produced onto the working tree.
- `codex mcp-server` — run codex as an MCP server and call it as tools with session
  continuity; an alternative integration to subprocess dispatch for harnesses that prefer it.
- Direct `codex exec` calls: stdin is always read and concatenated with the prompt — if stdin
  is open but silent the process hangs forever with zero output. Close it (`</dev/null`) when
  no plan is piped. stderr carries the thinking stream; filter or capture it deliberately.
- Timeouts scale with effort: reasoning at `low` typically finishes in a couple of minutes;
  `xhigh` can legitimately run 20+. Set `max_minutes` per executor accordingly rather than
  one global number.

## Operational notes

- **Effort:** the mandatory-set rule and the per-dispatch `--effort` override live in
  `references/config.md`'s executor table.
- **Expect harness overhead.** A codex run carries its system prompt, skills, and hook
  context — on the order of 15–20K input tokens before the plan. Cache discounts absorb
  most of it on resumed sessions; budget for it on one-shot runs of cheap models.
- **Model metadata warnings** (`Model metadata for '…' not found`) are benign for custom
  providers; set `extra_config` overrides (e.g. `model_context_window`) if a model needs them.
- **`codex exec review`** runs in a read-only sandbox that requires working user namespaces
  (bubblewrap). parable's `review` subcommand instead pipes the diff into a normal executor
  run — identical coverage, no sandbox dependency.
